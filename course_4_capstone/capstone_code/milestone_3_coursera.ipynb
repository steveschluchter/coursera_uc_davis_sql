    "I created a heatmap of correlations of a few countable items, and I found stronger relationships in terms of Pearson Correlations between the statuses_count, friends_count, and the listed_count fields.  It appears that being prolific on twitter does come with some gravity in tweets and retweets: the more you tweet, the more retweets and friends you'll get.  This seems obvious, but the data do bear that out.\n",

    "    I built a social network using tweets with specific handles mentioned in the tweet, and each edge of the graph is of the form (sender_handle, handle_mentioned_in_tweet).  This graph is quite large and it's going to be difficult to get a mathematically sophisticated metric.\n",

    "I'm interested in the effect that a higher sentiment score has on a tweet being retweeted.  I'm also interested in some entry level centrality measures of a social network I can create using the twitter data.  It looks like a higher sentiment score does indeed have an impact on a tweet being retweeted.  I'll mention that in my final report.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create 1 or 2 new metrics to track relationships of data you discovered. Explain why you created them.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm computing centrality metrics for the social network graph that I created because I wanted to get a sense of basic social network analysis.  We'll see if I can actually compute all of them quickly enough.  Thus far, only the degree centrality seems to be computable without too much of a wait."
