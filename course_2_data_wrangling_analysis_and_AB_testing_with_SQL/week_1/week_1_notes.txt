Develop healthy skepticism around the data you get: it's cleanliness, the data integrity, etc..

Your data is of unknown quality.

We use Mode analytics for this course.
We build off of existing SQL knowledge.

COALESCE and Windowing functions.  GET ready to cover these in more detail.

SELECT (CASE WHEN parameter_name =='viewed_user_id'
        THEN CAST (parameter_value AS INT)
        ELSE NULL
        END) AS viewed_user_id
FROM
    dsv1069.events
WHERE
    event_name = 'view_user_profile'

SELECT get_json(raw.viewed_user_id) AS viewed_user_id
FROM
    dev.1069.enents
WHERE
    event_name = 'view_user


Table names may contain clues that the data are unreliable or not to be used.

SELECT *
FROM example_table et
JOIN other_example_table oet
ON oet.user_id = et.user_id
AND et.user_id IS NOT NULL;

The COALESCE function is available in some types of SQL, and it allows one to replace NULL withsomething else.
SELECT
    COALESCE(parent_user_id, user_id) as original_user_id
    parent_user_id
    user_id
FROM dsv1069.users;


Counting is hard when the questions are ambiguous: do you trust your data, make sure you know what your data can and can't tell you, and COUNT WITH CARE!
