Wildcards for text matching, too.

IN Vs. OR: In has: a long list of options, IN executes faster than OR, you don't have to think about the order with IN, and the IN clause can contain another SELECT statement.

In SQL, AND is processed before OR, and NOT is processed before AND.

Wildcards: LIKE, %, _.

LIKE is technically a predicate, but we sometimes call it an operator anyway.

% will not match NULL values.

_ is a wildcard for a single character.  It's not supported by DB2.


Brackets will specify a set of characters in a specific location.  This does NOT work with SQLite.

Wildcards take longer to run.  Use some other comparator if possible.

ORDER BY 2, 3 -- orders by the second and third column of a query.

A HAVING clause counts groups accounted for in GROUP BY clauses.

A GROUP BY does not order the data on its own.  You should still use the ORDER BY clause.
